Just stumbled out of the theater, feeling like I've been put through a mental washing machine set to high confusion. Antes del cuerpo. What was that? I mean, I think I liked it? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it was like eating a sandwich made by a slightly drunk genius chef – half the time you're marveling at what you're tasting, the other half, you're like Did they just use pickle juice instead of dressing?

That opening scene, though. Wow. Whoever thought of that must have some wild dreams. I remember leaning over to my friend like, Is this art or did someone just drop the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 camera into their fever dream? But hey, it worked. It sort of set the tone for this whole rollercoaster without a seat belt. There were bits that felt like poetry stitched together with duct tape. I’m not even kidding.

> So, there’s this moment where the lead character goes on this existential rant about fish tanks. Seriously, fish tanks. I'm sitting there thinking, Dude, I came for a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, not an aquarium TED Talk. But honestly, it kinda hit me afterwards that life might just be one big fish tank. Or maybe I was just hungry. When they showed that bowl of ramen, I almost crawled through the screen to slurp it up.

Oh, and the colors. My eyes are still adjusting. It’s like they thought, “Let’s dump the whole Crayola factory onto the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 reel.” At one point, I couldn’t tell if it was a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 or a psychedelic therapy session. Lou Reed once said, Take a walk on the wild side, and this? This felt like a sprint. 

What’s the deal with that ending though? Just when I thought I understood everything, they toss in a curveball. I won't spoil it for you – go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , seriously – but let’s say, if you don't leave the theater with at least one eyebrow raised, you probably fell asleep midway.

Here’s some nonsense that popped in my head when the credits rolled: 

```javascript
function confuseViewer( ) {
    let plotTwists = ['fish', 'colors', 'ramen'];
    plotTwists.forEach((twist) => {
        console.log('Did that just happen with a ' + twist + '?');
    });
}
confuseViewer('Antes del cuerpo');
```

P.S. If you're into 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that make you go Wait, what? six times an hour, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it if it comes around your local indie theater. Just, maybe, don’t go in expecting a cohesive narrative flow. Like me, you might come out with a slightly fried brain and an urge to talk about fish tanks.
